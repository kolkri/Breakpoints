  <h1>Breakpoints</h1>

  <p>
    In software development, a breakpoint means a deliberate stop 
    or interrupt point in a program that has been implemented for 
    debugging. It is also sometimes simply called as a break. 
    Generally speaking, a breakpoint is a way to obtain information
    about a program during its execution. During an interruption, 
    the programmer receives information about whether the program 
    is working as was expected. At a more practical level, the 
    breakpoint indicates (using one or more defined conditions) 
    when program execution should be interrupted. Breakpoints are 
    very useful especially while testing large and complex programs. 
    By setting a breakpoint in a program, the program is allowed 
    to run up to the breakpoint and then  the values of various 
    registers and variables can be examined or modified.<br>
